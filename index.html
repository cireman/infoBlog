    <h2>
      Essential Concepts of Web Development
    </h2>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HyperText Markup Language. It is the most basic component of the web. It defines the meaning and structure of content.
    </p>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>
      HTML tags will help us to provide structure and semantics to the content of our website and each one has different characteristics and uses although visually they give a similar result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many tags are easy to differentiate such as headings or images and other different ones such as header, footer, section or div, this is where semantics will be the answer and if we know a little English we can also get a small idea of its use but in this course we will use the most important and that will be part of your day to day as a Software Developer.
    </p>
    <h3>DOM</h3>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model is a tree structure that will represent all our web projects as if it were a family tree: parents, children, siblings with infinite levels. When we understand this nesting we can identify dependencies, inheritance in css and how complex our project is.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/dom.png" alt="tree structure that represent the Document Object Model" title="DOM represetation">
    <h3>Semantics</h3>
    <p>
      Semantics gives meaning to every element that exists on a website, some elements will be merely decorative and should not mean anything but others will be titles and should be in different hierarchies or some sections will be more relevant than others, this will help search engines like Google or Duck Duck Go to differentiate your content, categorize and will be the most valuable tools to be in the first SEO search results. It will also help the accessibility of your website, so that people with different abilities can understand each content.
    </p>
    <h3>Atributes</h3>
    <p>
      Attributes give extra features to the tags to complement information and are preprogrammed by the browser, some attributes work on all tags in the same way like 'class' but other attributes work on only some tags like src.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is the style language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents.
    </p>

    <h2>Box Model</h2>
    <h3>The box model is composed of:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Content size (width and height)</li>
      <li>padding</li>
      <li>border</li>
      <li>margin</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Physical properties for the box model:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>width / height</li>
      <li>margin / margin-top | margin-right | margin-bottom | margin-left</li>
      <li>border / border-top | border-right | border-bottom | border-left</li>
      <li>padding / padding-top | padding-right | padding-bottom | padding-left</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Logical properties for the box model:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>inline-size / block-size</li>
      <li>margin-block | margin-inline | margin-block-start | margin-block-end | margin-inline-start | margin-inline-end</li>
      <li>border-block | border-inline | border-block-start | border-block-end | border-inline-start | border-inline-end</li>
